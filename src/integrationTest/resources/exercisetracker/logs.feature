Feature: Workout Log Completion

  Scenario: Completing a log sets the end time and returns a response
    Given a log exists in the repository
    When the log is completed
    Then the log should have an end time
    And a response entity should be returned

  Scenario: Completing a log with new personal records saves them
    Given a log exists in the repository
    And the log has sets with new personal records
    When the log is completed
    Then the personal records should be saved to the database

  Scenario: Completing a log without personal records does not save them
    Given a log exists in the repository
    And no sets in the log achieve a new personal record
    When the log is completed
    Then no personal records should be saved
#    And the workout summary should not include a personal records section

  Scenario: Completing a log sends a message to the SQS queue
    Given a log exists in the repository
    When the log is completed
    Then a message should be sent to the SQS queue
#
#  Scenario: Completing a log triggers the lambda function via SQS
#    Given a log exists in the repository
#    When the log is completed
#    Then a message should be sent to the SQS queue
#    And the Lambda function should be triggered with that message
#
#  Scenario: Lambda saves workout summary to S3 after receiving message from SQS
#    Given a message exists in the SQS queue
#    When the Lambda function processes the message
#    Then a workout summary file should be saved to the S3 bucket
#
#  Scenario: Lambda fails to save the summary file to S3
#    Given a valid message exists in the SQS queue
#    And the S3 bucket does not exist or is unreachable
#    When the Lambda processes the message
#    Then the error should be logged
#    And the Lambda should not crash
#
#  Scenario: Lambda fails while processing a message from SQS
#    Given a valid message exists in the SQS queue
#    And the Lambda function contains a bug or raises an exception
#    When the Lambda processes the message
#    Then the error should be logged
#    And the message should remain in the queue for retry
#
#  Scenario: Completing a non-existent log returns 404
#    Given no log exists with ID 999
#    When I send a PUT request to "/logs/999/complete"
#    Then the response status should be 404
#    And the response body should contain "Could not find log 999"
#
#  Scenario: An unexpected error occurs during log completion
#    Given a log exists in the repository
#    And an internal error occurs while processing the log
#    When the log is completed
#    Then the response status should be 500
#    And the response body should contain "Internal Server Error"
#
#  Scenario: Completing a log with no exercises
#    Given a log exists in the repository
#    And the log contains no exercises
#    When the log is completed
#    Then the response should still be 201
#    And no personal records should be saved
#    And the summary should contain only workout metadata
